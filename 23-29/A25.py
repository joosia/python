# Add a "divide" operation to your calculator from the previous assignment and make sure it can handle division by zero(use try and except). If a division by zero occurs return None.

# What happens when you try to divide 5‚ÅÑ2? Try to come up with a reason why the result is a bit off.

# Note: Returning None like this is usually not the correct choice, but in this case it is done for simplicity.
